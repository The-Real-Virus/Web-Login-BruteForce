# üíÄWeb Login BruteForceüíÄ

## üìúDescription
This is an interactive Python script designed to perform brute force login attacks on a target web application.  
It allows users to test a list of passwords against a specific username on a given target URL.  
The script provides multiple detection methods to identify successful logins, making it flexible  
and adaptable for various target systems.  

## üîëFeatures
- Accepts target URL, username, and password file path dynamically.  
- Keyword detection in response (e.g., "welcome back").  
- URL redirection detection (e.g., /dashboard).  
- Cookie/token-based success detection (e.g., auth_token).  
- HTTP status code-based success detection (e.g., 200 or 302).  

## üöÄStep-by-Step Guide in Linux Terminal !

Step 1: Update & upgrade your system  
>sudo apt update  
>sudo apt upgrade  

Step 2: Clone the repository  
>git clone https://github.com/The-Real-Virus/Web-Login-BruteForce.git  

Step 3: Go to the Tool Directory where u clone it and read requirements.txt file !  
>cd Web-Login-BruteForce      
(read requirements.txt file using cat or gedit)  

Step 4: extract the rockyou file using unrar  
>sudo apt install unrar (if it is not installed in ur kali linux)  
>unrar x rockyou.rar  

Step 5: After Completing the process now u can run script  
>python3 Script.py  

## ‚öôÔ∏èTroubleshooting
1) `Missing :` 'rockyou.txt' file: If the script doesn't find the rockyou.txt file, make sure it is in the same
directory or specify the full path in the script.

2) `Permission Denied:` Ensure the script is run with the necessary privileges.

3) `Module Error :` If the requests module is not installed, install it ( see requirements.txt for commands )

## üí°Steps to Determine the Needle !
1) Analyze the Login Response for Success:  
- Use tools like Postman, Burp Suite, or browser developer tools (F12) to inspect the HTTP response from the server.  
- Perform a valid login with correct credentials and observe the response.  
- Does the page redirect to a dashboard or profile page?  
- Is there a success message like "Welcome back," "Login successful," or similar?  
- Are there unique strings in the page content that indicate success (e.g., profile, logout, etc.)?  

2) Analyze the Response for Failures:  
- Perform a login with incorrect credentials and observe the error messages.  
- Compare the failed response with a successful one to identify what changes (e.g., missing or added keywords, response codes, etc.).  

3) Give the Needle when run:  
- Once you identify , Choose a detection method and write the needle ( of success login ).  

## ü§ùFollow the Prompts !
*) The script will guide you through the following steps:  
- Enter the target URL (e.g., http://example.com:8080/login).  
- Enter the username to test (e.g., admin).  
- Provide the path to the password file (e.g., rockyou.txt).  
- Choose a detection method(needle):  
  1: Keyword detection in the response.  
  2: URL redirection detection.  
  3: Cookie/token detection.  
  4: HTTP status code detection.  
- If required, specify the success keyword, redirect URL, cookie name, or HTTP status code.  

## üõ†Ô∏èMODIFICATION ( use own wordlist )

if u want to use ur own wordlist instead of rockyou.txt , u can modify in the script ,  

Step 1: create ur own wordlist  

Step 2: move it into the Web-Login-BruteForce Directory ( deleting rockyou is not necessory )  

Step 3: While running the script , it ask for password file then type the name of ur own created list .  

## üìÇExample OutPut
	==== Interactive Login Bruteforce Script ====
	Enter the target URL (e.g., http://example.com:8080/login): http://testsite.com:8080/login
	Enter the username to test: admin
	Enter the path to the password file (e.g., rockyou.txt): passwords.txt

	[?] Detection Methods: 
	1. Search for a specific success keyword in the response (e.g., 'welcome back').
	2. Detect redirection to a specific URL (e.g., '/dashboard').
	3. Check for a specific cookie or authentication token (e.g., 'auth_token').
	4. Match a specific HTTP status code (e.g., 200 or 302).

	Choose a detection method (1/2/3/4): 1
	Enter the success keyword (e.g., 'welcome back'): welcome back

	==== Starting Bruteforce ====
	Target: http://testsite.com:8080/login
	Username: admin
	Password file: passwords.txt
	Number of passwords to test: 5

	[1/5] Attempting -> admin:password123
	[2/5] Attempting -> admin:qwerty
	[>>>] Success! Valid password 'qwerty' found for user 'admin'.

	==== Bruteforce Complete ====
